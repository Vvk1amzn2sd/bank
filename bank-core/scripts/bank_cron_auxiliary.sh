# --- Auxiliary Cron Job Script ---
# Purpose: Dummy script for background tasks (e.g., health checks, reporting, interest calculation)
#         Since transfers are instant, this handles eventual consistency/auxiliary processes.

# 1. Log the start of the job
echo "[$DATE] Cron job started for bank-core auxiliary tasks." >> $LOG_FILE

# 2. APPLICATION COMMAND PLACEHOLDER:
# Example of what a real DDD utility job might do:
# java -jar target/bank-core-1.0.jar run_daily_reports >> $LOG_FILE 2>&1

# 3. Dummy check
echo "[$DATE] Health check/Maintenance complete." >> $LOG_FILE

echo "[$DATE] Cron job finished." >> $LOG_FILE
